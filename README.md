# Code documentation
Every script and function has its own header with a brief description of its functionality, inputs, and outputs. We suggest exploring the code and the main modules in `utils/` to get familiarised with its structure.

# Data organization
This work is mostly based on Ulrich Hoffmann et. al. work: Hoffmann, Ulrich, Jean-Marc Vesin, Touradj Ebrahimi, and Karin Diserens. ‘An Efficient P300-Based Brain–Computer Interface for Disabled Subjects’. Journal of Neuroscience Methods 167, no. 1 (January 2008): 115–25. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.03.005

We recommend to familiarise with the original data's structure and the experiment performed by the authors, the data can be downloaded from here: TODO publish data link here

# General data formatting
There are three data formats employed along all the scripts:
1. The original one: TODO explain a bit
2. The SkLearn one: TODO explain a bit
3. The sorted one: TODO explain a bit

# Code hierarchy
The code is divided into the following folders:
- `Baseline/`: TODO explain a bit
    - TODO: Briefly explain every script
- `Fixed Parameters/`: TODO explain a bit
    - TODO: Briefly explain every script
- `First Coincidence/`: TODO explain a bit
    - TODO: Briefly explain every script
- `Gain - Loss balance/`: TODO explain a bit
    - TODO: Briefly explain every script
- `scripts/`: TODO explain a bit
    - `LDA`: TODO explain a bit
        - TODO: Briefly explain every script
    - `Plots`: TODO explain a bit
        - TODO: Briefly explain every script
    - `Preprocessing`: TODO explain a bit
        - TODO: Briefly explain every script
- `execute_all_methods.sh`: TODO explain a bit

# Environment
The original environment used to execute this code was:
- OS: Arch Linux - EndeavourOS (64b)
- Python: 3.10.14
- Packages: they can be found within the `requirements.txt` file.
